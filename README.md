### üê≥ Ingwe Bika LIMS 4 - Docker Suite

This repository provides an official Docker-based distribution of [Bika Open Source LIMS](https://www.bikalims.org).

Ingwe is a powerful, feature‚Äërich laboratory information management system built on the rock‚Äësolid foundation of Senaite. At its core, Ingwe shares Senaite's modern architecture, clean UI, robust API, and proven modularity.¬†But Ingwe goes further. Professionally supported by [Bika Lab Systems](https://bikalabs.com), Bika and Senaite service provider since 2002, Ingwe delivers more than a platform - it delivers two decades of deep domain expertise, innovation, and commitment to your lab's success.

With Ingwe, you get all of Senaite's core strengths, plus extensive enhancements and refinements commissioned by forward‚Äëthinking laboratories and maintained by the Bika team. The result is a more capable and more efficient LIMS - backed by dedicated support from the people who have been perfecting laboratory solutions for over 20 years.

üí° The release contains only Docker packaging, deployment scripts, and documentation - not the application source code which lives in their own repositories.
It aims to install a fully functional LIMS with key-add-ons, ready to be used. Not all available add-ons have been integrated and are available from their source repositories. See the Manifest below. Sadly Invoicing did not make the cut, it is the first priority for an upgrade.

**NB Full installations** are better suited for development environments, and including a load balancer, for production environments.  Please see the [Installation Manual](https://github.com/bikalims/bika.documentation/blob/main/docs/BikaSenaiteServerIntroduction.md).
